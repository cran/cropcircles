Description: Images are cropped to a circle with a transparent background. The function takes a
  vector of images, either local or from a link, and circle crops the image. Paths to the
  cropped image are returned for plotting with 'ggplot2'. Also includes cropping to a hexagon,
  heart, parallelogram, and square.
